Randomness plays an essential role in shaping financial risk. Even when asset prices are modeled using the same assumptions—such as fixed drift and volatility—the actual price paths that emerge can vary widely. This becomes evident in simulations of Geometric Brownian Motion, where all paths start from the same initial value yet diverge over time. These differences arise purely due to randomness, highlighting how uncertainty is embedded in financial systems.

An important takeaway is that risk is not about accurately forecasting a single future price. Instead, it is about understanding the range of possible outcomes that may occur. Volatility determines how widely these outcomes are spread. Higher volatility results in a broader distribution of potential final prices, which increases uncertainty. As a result, two assets with identical expected returns can still exhibit very different risk characteristics if their volatilities differ.

The histogram of final prices reinforces this perspective. Rather than producing one definite result, the simulation generates a distribution of outcomes, emphasizing that risk must be analyzed probabilistically. In financial markets, losses should not be viewed as rare exceptions but as natural possibilities arising from randomness. Therefore, effective risk management requires focusing on distributions, variability, and extreme outcomes, rather than relying solely on single-point predictions.
